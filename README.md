# CrowMartDemo
----------------------------
## Instructions to run: 
 1. Transpile .ts files to .js by running `npm run build` from the root directory.
 
 2. Start development server by running `npm start` in the root as well.
 
 3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/index.html` and you will arrive at the homepage of the CrowMartDemo
 
 ## About the system: 
 - IndexedDB API to make persistent local storage in the client
 - No bundling tool, ES6 js is run straight from the html files as a module
 - The site should send an alert when the remarketing score reaches a certain threshold. This may take a bit of clicking around.
